Being a word list editor means you are able to make edits to the Globasa lexicon and their translations. That data is kept in a spreadsheet on Google Docs.

Periodically, this spreadsheet is downloaded and run thru and import script to update the [online dictionary app](https://menalari.globasa.net/eng/).

The word list spreadsheet is located at [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z_atqWgsTVz23uNqVqdYq8LKSBPnW3-sknbftGnzpdc/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z_atqWgsTVz23uNqVqdYq8LKSBPnW3-sknbftGnzpdc/edit?usp=sharing)
