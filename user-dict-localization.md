The [Globasa dictionary web application](https://menalari.globasa.net/) is availble in more than one language. To have it's UI work for supported languages, we need translations of each component. This is called localization and internationalization. (Or, i18n for short, because it has 18 letters in the word.)

We currently use a Google Sheets spreadsheet that has the ID of each component, and the text for each supported language in columns. You must be added by spreadsheet owners to make changes or additions.

The spreadsheet is located at: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17auYHH9wmG1xPWhgjh5zYbghZTCdZD54y7rzBo4Lx3Q/edit?usp=sharing

**Important**: You must not change the column headers (row 1) or the import script will not know what the column contains.
