# User: Document Editors

There are multiple documents that need to be edited. You can edit them in many ways. I'm going to focus on Prose.io, but you can test alternatives.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Make a GitHub Account

**No, actually, give the email address first and just get the invite straight away from the admin.**

We store all our files on GitHub. Each collection is in a GitHub repository of files. If you don't have an account, you must use an email address to sign up for GitHub. If needed, a Globasa email account can be created for those who do not want to use a free email service or their personal email address.

1. Give your email address (or GitHub username if you have one) to the administrator.
2. If you do not have a GitHub account, go to the [GitHub Signup page](https://github.com/signup) and create your account. Follow those steps, including entering the code that is emailed to you, and signing in to GitHub.
3. The administrator will go to [https://github.com/orgs/Globasa-Team/people](https://github.com/orgs/Globasa-Team/people) and click 'Invite member' and send the invite with the username or email address.
4. You will get an email invite. Click 'Join @Globasa-Team' which will take you to GitHub, or go to [https://github.com/orgs/Globasa-Team/invitation](https://github.com/orgs/Globasa-Team/invitation).
5. Select the 'Join Globasa Team' button.

Congrats. You are now a member of the GitHub Globasa team. Next you will need to connect an editor.

### Step 2: Connect Prose.io

There are many options programmers can use to connect to their GitHub account. To edit content on GitHub 

1. Go to https://prose.io/
2. Click 'authorise on GitHub'
3. Click 'Authorise prose' for public and private repositories. (Or click back to change that if you have private repos.)

You will now be in the Prose, and can edit files in each file repository (repo). Here are the key repos:

Desktop

You can use the GitHub desktop client to sync files to your computer, edit them directly, and then upload them. Or so I'm told. You will want a markdown editor installed on your computer, ideally.
